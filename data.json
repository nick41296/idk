    "apr": "Your credit card has an annual percentage rate (APR) — which is essentially the price you pay to borrow money from the bank to charge purchases on the card.",

    "cd": "Certificates of deposit — also called CDs — are deposit accounts that require you to commit your savings for a specified period of time, which may be anywhere from one month to several years — meaning you can’t withdraw the money without paying penalty fees. They have higher interest rates, though. More money for you.",
    "fico": "Your FICO score is a number between 300 and 850 that evaluates your risk as a borrower. Since the number is based on how well, or poorly, you’ve managed your money obligations over time, lenders use it determine how big of a loan they think you can handle and the likelihood that you’ll pay it back.",
    "overdraft": "The way an overdraft fee works is if you make a transaction that drops your account balance below zero, the bank covers the difference, or puts your account into negative funds — and then charges you a fee for it — typically around $35. Plus you also owe the bank the difference.",
    "nsf": "Banks charge a non-sufficient funds fee (NSF) when you don’t have enough money available in your checking account to cover a transaction.",
